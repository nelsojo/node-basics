                  <p>The most complex thing I have done so far with my web development skills is to take a Wordpress site and recreate
                     the site in a static format. The site was mostly informational and was composed of text and images with a few sliders.
                     At this point I had only worked on sites using templates and had built some small static websites from scratch
                     in a previous web development class in December 2020. This was a fun challange because the customer wanted to implement all 
                     styling using JavaScript bootstrap. I learned a lot about applying styles with javascript but I'd like to learn how to write javascript
                     from scratch.</p> 
         
               <h2><span id = "colorDarkblue"> What do you hope to learn from this class?</span></h2> 
                  <h3>There are 2 skills I'd like to develop in this class</h3>     
                     <ol>
                        <li><p>I hope to learn a lot more about JavaScripit in this class. I've studied web development and worked small jobs
                        as a developer but I have never really learned to use JavaScript regularly. I'd like the hone this skill such that
                        it becomes as natural as writing HTML and CSS.</p></li> 
                     
                     <li><p>I'd also like to understand the professional workflow common in Web Development teams. In particular I want to become
                        proficient at using GitHub to handle version control. Manaually tracking changes has always been tedious and I'd like to
                         learn a more efficient way to manage website updates.  </p></li>

                <p>In July of 2020 I took part in a robotics competition hosted by NCAS (Nasa Community College Aerospace Scholars). This event was the 
                   culmination of a year-long program with NCAS where we learned about the basics of space travel and reasearch and wrote a proposal for a
                   key element (such as an incremental plan for building an outpost) NASA believes is needed to implement a manned mission to mars. 
                   I learned much about space explopration and took part in a competition where teams built small scale robotic rovers
                   and programmed them to collect objects from a mock mars terrain course. My role was to create the routines the 
                   rover used to travel around the course and return objects to the base. </p>
